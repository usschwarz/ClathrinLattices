#########################################################################


Code was developed using the following versions

- Python 2.7.11
- Numpy 1.15.2
- Networkx 2.1
- Scipy 0.13.0b1
- Matplotlib 1.5.1
- Shapely 1.6.4.post2
- Ellipse Fitter 0.1.3.0

(1) Make sure that you have installed all required python packages e.g.
networkx,concorde,EllipseFitter,shapely

(2) Use the ClathrinGrowthMain.py script to simulate the growth of 
clathrin lattices.

(3) Choose the binding model: mode=

"km": knee model, 
"am": ankle model, 
"am": heel model, 
"ham": ankle-heel model, 
"tm": toe model

(4) Choose input area distribution: input_data=
"EM": area distribution deduced from EM
"CLEM": area distribution deduced from CLEM

(5) Choose the number of simulated lattices: number_of_clusters= "number"

(6) Choose whether lattices are shown: show_lattice= "True" or "False"

(7) The results are saved in the output files in the output folder.

(8) In the output files all information concerning the size and shape of 
simulated clathrin lattices is saved. The files are organized as follows:

1. row: area of the lattice
2. row: edge length of the lattice
3. row: number of structural gaps of the lattice
4. row: number of triskelia 
5. row: solidity of the lattice
6. row: aspect ratio of the lattice 

(9) Please note that the TSPSolver from concorde.tsp prints various messages to the screen.
